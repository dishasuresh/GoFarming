 <h3>Information of Ragi</h3>

   <p>Finger millet have been cultivated in India from as far back as 4000 years ago. Now the Indian states of Karnataka, Andhra Pradesh, Tamil Nadu, Bihar and a few others produce ragi. Karnataka is the top producer of Ragi and has 58% share in India's export of this crop. Ragi is another coarse grain which has high nutrition value (carbohydrate 73%, protein 9.2%) and is used as staple food by poor people in south India. Its plant is considered as indigenous of India. In Babarnama there is a mention of using this crop for making wine.
   Ragi in Kannada is known as the Finger millet (Eleusine coracana) or African millet, an annual plant widely grown as a cereal in the arid regions of Africa and Asia. Finger Millet is originally native to the Ethiopian Highlands and was introduced to India about 4000 year ago. Ragi crops are normally grown in the Himalaya up to 2,300 metres in elevation as it very adaptable to higher elevations.
   Finger millet crops are often intercropped with legumes like peanuts, cowpeas and pigeon peas or other plants such as Niger seeds. In India Ragi is commonly called by various names like ragi (in Kannada, Telugu and Hindi), Kodra (Himachal Pradesh), Mandia (Oriya), Taidalu (in Telangana region), Ariyam in Tamil etc. It is a traditional food plant in Africa and has the potential to improve nutrition, boost food security and support sustainable landcare.</p>


<h3>Cultivation Process</h3>

<p>
Ragi is cultivated on a variety of soils ranging from rich loam to poor shallow upland soils.
It prefers porous and well drained loam to light red loam and sandy loam soils of good fertility but reasonable water holding capacity.
The millets are a group of small seeded species of cereal crops or grains widely grown around the world for food and fodder. They have been in cultivation in East Asia for the last 10,000 years. There are a variety of millets and widely cultivated species are the Pearl millet (Pennisetum glaucum) known as Bajra in India, Foxtail millet (Setaria italica), Proso millet or common millet or broom corn millet or hog millet or white millet (Panicum miliaceum) and the Finger millet (Eleusine coracana) known as Ragi or Mandwa in India.
 It can tolerate some water logging. Black soils with sufficient drainage capacity also support to cultivate Ragi crop.
In southern India, it predominates on marginal soil conditions, provided by lateritic and red sandy loams.
It withstands and thrives well on slightly alkaline soils too. It seems to have ability to utilize rock phosphate than other cereals do.
The soil should be rich in organic matter. Deep vertisols and rocky soils are not suitable for this crop owing to poor drainage and low fertility.
 It can be grown in soils with pH of 4.5-7.5.
Tank silt is applied to the soil just before the rain begins and soon after the land is ploughed thrice to incorporate weeds in the soil.
Heavy clay soils with poor drainage is less suitable
Although statistics on individual millet species are confused, and are sometimes combined with sorghum, it is estimated that finger millet is grown on approximately 38,000 km2.</p>
<p>India is a major cultivator of finger millet with a total cultivated area of 15870 km2. The state of Karnataka is the leading producer of finger millet, known as Ragi in the region, accounting for 58% of India's Ragi production.
Once harvested, the seeds keep extremely well and are seldom attacked by insects or moulds. The long storage capacity makes finger millet an important crop in risk-avoidance strategies for poorer farming communities.</p>

 
 
<h3>Regions</h3>

<p>Finger millets or ragi are mostly grown and consumed in Rajasthan, Karnataka, Andhra Pradesh, Tamil Nadu, Maharashtra and Goa.It was millets, rather than rice, that formed important parts of the prehistoric diet in Indian, Chinese Neolithic and Korean Mumun societies. Broomcorn (Panicum miliaceum) and foxtail millet were important crops beginning in the Early Neolithic of China. Millet made its way from China to the Black Sea region of Europe by 5000 BC. The cultivation of common millet as the earliest dry crop in East Asia has been attributed to its resistance to drought and this has been suggested to have aided its spread. Major research on millets is carried out by the International Crops Research Institute for the Semi-Arid Tropics in Andhra Pradesh, India, and by the USDA-ARS at Tifton, Georgia, USA.</p>


 <h3>Seasons</h3>
<p> Ragi is a Kharif crop, sown between May and August and harvested between September and JanuÂ­ary. In many parts of South India it is cultivated throughout the year by means of irrigation. The seeds are sown broadcast or with the help of drills and even transplanted on well-prepared friable beds ploughed several times. The crop requires 3 to 5 months to mature.</p>

 <h3>Health Benefits</h3>
 <p>Finger millet is especially valuable as it contains the amino acid methionine, which is lacking in the diets of hundreds of millions of the poor who live on starchy staples such as cassava, plantain, polished rice, or maize meal. Finger millet can be ground and cooked into cakes, puddings or porridge. The grain is made into a fermented drink (or beer) in Nepal and in many parts of Africa. The straw from finger millet is used as animal fodder. It is also used for a flavored drink in festivals.</p>

<p> Research has proven that millet grains are excellent and key to a healthy, wholesome diet and has a better balance of vitamins and minerals than wheat, barley, oats, rice or rye. It has amazing amounts of iron, Vit. B, complex protein, amino acids, phosphorus, magnesium and potassium and can be given to babies from age 5+ months as baby food like a porridge or combine it with milk/ yogurt/ veggies/ fruits which is a complete nutritious baby meal. Ragi flour cooked with a little milk and sugar is a tasty and easily digestible breakfast cereal.</p>

<p>In southern parts of India, pediatricians recommend finger-millet-based food for infants of six months and above because of its high nutritional content, especially Iron and calcium. Home made Ragi malt happens to be one of the most popular infant food even to this day.</p>

<p>The protein content in millet is very close to that of wheat; both provide about 11% protein by weight. Major portion of Ragi is carbohydrate, around 80%. The Fat percentage is quite less which is good. Protein and fibre content is not great but it is relatively less in their share. 100 grams of Ragi has roughly on an average of 336 KCal of energy in them.</p>
