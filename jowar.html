		<p>Among the different kinds of cereal crops in India, jowar occupies a major prominence. Besides being a staple diet for the poorer section of the society, it is also used for animal feed and industrial raw materials. Different parts of the country have the potential to have this important cereal crop grown, which is also a major product of agriculture in many other countries. Since it can grow in semi arid climates, where other crops do not have a chance of growing, this crop has been grown in these areas. Requiring semi arid climatic conditions, the jowar crop has proved to be a good agricultural practice in the country. In comparison to other cereal food items, jowar has a significant value. </p>
		<p> The cereal plant of jowar came up in historic times in the present day Ethiopia and east central Africa. It was probably in the first millennium that jowar plants were brought from African countries into India. Jowar or sorghum belongs to the Graminae family and grows to a height of about 4 mts. Seeds are rounded and pointed at the base, the color being brownish, yellow, pink or white.
			Importance of jowar as a crop is seen in its usage as animal feed and fodder, grown mostly in arid and semi arid climates of the world as well as in India. It is grown as a coarse grain. Its use in different kinds of commercial purposes is making jowar an important agricultural product in the whole world. It is used primarily as a livestock feed and fodder. Some places also have facilities to produce alcohol from jowar. The entire plant is used as forage, hay or silage. Sorghum has a sweet stock, which can be used as raw material for jaggery, ethanol, paper making and some other industrial purposes. In India, jowar has been included as a commodity in the commodity market. From the point of view of production, it is grown as a Rabi and kharif crop and also in summers.</p>

			<h3 id="C">Climatic Requirements </h3>
			<p>As a kharif crop, it grows well in areas having mean monthly temperature of 26°C to 33°C. However, the rabi crop can be grown in areas where the mean monthly temperature does not fall below 16°C. It requires more than 30 cm rainfall during the growing period and does not grow where the rainfall exceeds 100 cm. Jowar is par excellence a rainfed crop of dry farming areas where irrigation is not used. Both excessive moisture and prolonged droughts are harmful for its proper growth. Though it can be grown in a variety of soils including loamy and sandy soils, clayey deep regur and alluvium are the best suited soils for jowar. Most of the crop is grown in plain areas but it can also be raised on gentle slopes upto 1,200 metres height.
			</p><br />
			<h3 id="S">Soil Requirements </h3>
			<p>Sorghum or Jowar crop adapts wide range of soils but grows well in sandy loam soils having good drainage. Soil pH range of 6 to 7.5 is ideal for its cultivation and better growth. The main field should be ploughed and leveled to fine tilth for weeds free sowing. </p><br />

			<h3 id="L">Land Selection and Field Preparation </h3>
			<p>One should avoid rocky field and 1 to 2 ploughings followed by 2 crosswise harrowing are required to prepare a good seed bed. As the Sorghum or Jowar crop does not tolerate water lagging, the field should be prepared with well drainage.</p><br />

			<h3 id="SE">Seed rate and Sowing </h3>
			<p>Seed rate of 35-40 kg per hectare is well enough and sowing should be carried out by drilling @ row-to-row distance of 25 cm. Seed broadcasting should be avoided. The seed should nt be sowed more than 2 - 3 cm depth.</p><br />

			<h3 id="M">Manures and Fertilization </h3>
			<p>he main field should be added with 10 to15 tone of Farm Yard Manure (F.Y.M) to make the soil rich in micro nutrients. At the time of sowing, basal application of 60:40:40kg N: P2O5-K2O should be applied. Should apply 35kg N/ha top dressing 1 month after sowing. 60 to 65 kg N per hectare should be applied In low rainfall and rain fed areas at sowing time.  In Sulphur deficient soils, 45 to 60 kg Sulphur /ha should be added which not only improves biomass but also quality. For any other nutrient deficiencies, soil test should be done and accordingly, apply the manures and fertilizers at the time of soil preparation.</p><br/>

			<h3 id="I">Irrigation</h3>
			<p>If the crop is sown in monsoon time (July). it may require l to 3 irrigations depending upon rains. For summer crops, 6 to 7 irrigations may be carried out due to high temperature. In South India, Rabi season crops need about 4 to 5 irrigations.</p><br />

			<h3 id="W">Weed control/Inter culture operations</h3>
			<p>To control the weeds in Sorghum crop, weeder cum mulcher should be used to give 1hoeing @ 3 weeks crop stage. Should use pre-emergence application of atrazine @ 0.50 kg/ha in 650 liters of water to control the weeds effectively</p><br />

			<h3 id="IN">Insects/Pests in Sorghum or Jowar Farming</h3>
			<p>Stem borer, shootfly, stem borer & sorghum midge</P><br />

			<h3 id="H">How to control?</h3>
			<p>Use spray of carbofuran/malathion @ 125 ml/ha, to control sorghum midge, use spray of endosulphan @ 0.075.</p><br />

			<h3 id="HA">Harvesting</h3>
			<p>The crop will be ready in single cut varieties for harvesting @ 65 to 75 days after sowing (50%, flowering stage). In multi cut varieties, first cut should be done @ 45-50 days and subsequent cuts should be carried at 1 month intervals.</p><br /><br /><br />
