<h2>Type of soil</h2>

<p>Soil is the guiding factor in coffee plantation. The ideal soil is one with a good sub-surface drainage, and one that is easily workable. The presence of humus and other nitrogenous matter in the soil is an advantage.

When buying soil for growing coffee, the following values are recommended for coffee soil:

P (resin) - 15-30 µg/cm3
P (Mehlich 1): 10-20 ppm
SO4-S: 10-15 µg/cm3
K% CEC (pH 7.0): 10-15%
Ca% CEC (pH 7.0): 40-60%
Mg% CEC (pH 7.0): 10-15%
V%: 60-70%
CEC (pH 7.0): 7-10 meq/100 cm3
B (hot water): 0.4-0.5 ppm
B (0.05 N HCl): 1.0-1.2 ppm
Cu (Mehlich 1): 2-3 ppm
Zn (Mehlich 1): 4-7</p>

<a name="analysis"></a>
<h2>Analysis of Soil: Correcting Problems</h2>

<p>Lime is often used to help correct acidic soils to a pH between 4.5-5.5 in the first 20 cm of soil. When planting coffee, the holes should be covered with 250-500 g of limestone per meter. Production increases of up to 500% have been observed by adding limestone. The requirement for lime can be calculated as follows:

Lime needed = (T(V1-V2)/RPTN)p where
T - meq/100 cm3 of exchangeable H+Al+K+Ca+Mg
V1=S/T*100
RPTN=Relative Power of Total Nutrition.  The average is 75%.
p=factor of compensation for depth:
    = 0.5 for 0-10 cm.
    = 1.0 for 0-20 cm.
    =1.5 for 0-30 cm.

To correct problems with acidity below 20 cm deep phosphogypsum is often applied.  Mavolta suggest that phosphogypsum should be applied when aluminum saturation is higher than 20% or the participation of Ca in the effective CEC is lower than 40%.</p>

<a name="ferti"></a>
<h2>Coffee Fertilizer</h2>
<p>Since the coffee hullls and pulp are rich in nutrients, many people often use coffee grounds as fertilizer.  One 60 kg bag of coffee contains 1,026 g of nitrogen, 60 g of phosphorous, 918 g of potassium, 162 g of calcium, 90 g of magnesium, 72 g of sulfur, 0.96 g of boron, 0.80 g of copper, 3.6 g of iron, 1.2 g of manganese, 0.002 g of molybdenum, and 0.72 g of zinc.  The pulp resulting from processing contains 1,068 g of nitrogen, 84 g of phosphorous, 2,250 g of potassium, 246 g of calcium, 78 g of magnesium, 90 g of sulfur, 2.04 g of boron, 1.08 g of copper, 9.0 g of iron, 1.80 g of Manganese, 0.004 g of Molybdenum, and 4.20 g of Zinc.

Mineral deficiencies in mineral content can usually be detected visually from looking at the coffee bean leaves.  See Coffee Bean Leaf Analysis for more information on laboratory tests available.</p>

<a name="climate"></a>
<h2>Best Climate Conditions</h2>
<p>For growing Arabica coffee beans, there are two optimal growing climates:
The subtropical regions, at high altitudes of 16-24°. Rainy and dry seasons must be well defined, and altitude must be between 1800-3600 feet. These conditions result in one coffee growing season and one maturation season, usually in the coldest part of autumn.

The equatorial regions at latitudes lower than 10° and altitudes of 3600-6300 feet. Frequent rainfall causes almost continuous flowering, which results in two coffee harvesting seasons. The period of highest rainfall determines the main harvesting period, while the period of least rainfall determines the second harvest season. Because rainfall is too frequent for patio drying to occur,  artificial drying with mechanical dryers is performed in this type of coffee growing environment.</p>

<a name="harvest"></a>
<h2>How to Harvest Coffee Beans</h2>
<p>Ripe cherries are either harvested by hand, stripped from the tree with both unripe and overripe beans, or all the coffee beans are collected using a harvesting machine.  These processes are called selective picking, stripping, and mechanical harvesting, respectively. To maximize the amount of ripe coffee harvested, it is necessary to selectively pick the ripe coffee beans from the tree by hand and leave behind unripe, green beans to be harvested at a later time. </p>

<a name="preparation"></a>
<a name="roast"></a>
<h2>Preparation</h2>
<h3>Roasting</h3>
<p>The first stage is endothermic.  The green beans are slowly dried to become a yellow color and the beans begin to smell like toast or popcorn.

The second step, often called the first crack, occurs at approximately 205 °C (400 °F) in which the bean doubles in size, becomes a light brown color, and experiences a weight loss of approximately 5%.  The corresponding Agtron number for this color is between 95-90.

In the next step the temperature rises from 205 °C to approximately 220 °C, the color changes from light brown to medium brown, and a weight loss of approximately 13% occurs.  The resulting chemical process is called pyrolysis and is characterized by a change in the chemical composition of the bean as well as a release of CO2.

The second step is followed by a short endothermic period which is followed by another exothermic step called the second crack.  This second pyrolysis occurs between 225-230°C, and the roast color is defined as medium-dark brown.  The second pop is much quicker sounding and the beans take on an oily sheen.</p>

<h3>Grinding</h3>
<p>Coffee Grinders: Bur, Blade Coffee Grinder Reviews

There are two main types of coffee bean grinders available.  Blade coffee grinders sell for about $20, grind the bean unevenly, and are messy.  Burr coffee grinders, are about $60-$125, grind evenly, and are clean and easy.  The extra investment is one of the best you will make, as burr grinders improve both the coffee quality and the ease of brewing.

For any scientific analysis, a blade grinder is unacceptable due to its lack of reproducibility.

Burrs should be replaced periodically (every 600-2000 lbs of coffee), but for typical home use it is only necessary to clean the burrs.

<h2>Brewing</h2>
<p>Brewing coffee is as much of an art as it is a science. The history of coffee brewing equipment is rich, and methods of brewing are culturally dependent. Of the thousands of coffee machines and coffee brewing devices invented since the advent of coffee consumption, only a few have gained worldwide popularity. The coffee brewing methods discussed below are recommended since they have been found to maximize the extraction of the beneficial flavors of coffee, while minimizing the extraction of bitter coffee compounds a nd undesirable components.
The following general rules apply to each coffee making process discussed. Coffee should be brewed for 4.5-5 minutes using a ratio of 55 grams of ground coffee per liter of filtered water (195-205°F). It is convenient to use 2 tablespoons of coffee per 6 ounces of filtered water. Filtered water and spring water are recommended. Tap water imparts off flavors to the coffee and some minerals are essential to coffee flavor. Distilled water is not recommended for brewing coffee as it lacks the minerals to bring out the natural flavors of the coffee.</p>
